# Netflix-Userbase
Used a Netflix Dataset from Kaggle to analyze the data through graphs, visualizations, calculations + more.


**My Goal here in my First Data Analysis/Science project is to analyze this data using Python code, using a multitude of Libraries, hoping to analyze Netflix Userbase metrics/Data to see how Netflix is performing. To clarify, I am using ChatGPT to help me seek out different ways to visualize the dataset I am using, while I'm still learning the fundamentals of Data Analysis & Science.**
